===

To test the application, just clone the code from the repository:

git clone git://github.com/whtt-eric/qfeedreader.git

In order to use Juggernaut, you must install the following gems:

sudo gem install json
sudo gem install eventmachine
sudo gem install juggernaut

Make sure to update the database.yml file and run the migrations:

cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
rake db:migrate

Next, start the Juggernaut server, the application server and a Delayed::Job worker:

juggernaut -c juggernaut.yml
ruby script/server
rake jobs:work

Now point your browser to http://localhost:3000. You should see a confirmation message saying 'Juggernaut Connected on localhost:5001'. If you're using Firebug it will appear in the console otherwise it will appear as an alert on the page.

Finally, add a few RSS feeds using the form on the page. To refresh the feeds, just click the "refresh" link.
